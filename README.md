### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I am a GitHub Principal Field Solution Engineer, DevOpsologist and ALM MVP Alumni.

âš¡ I live in the Texas, but am proudly South African! 

âš¡ After completing an MSc in Computer Science at Rhodes University, I worked as a developer (first in Linux using C++ and moving to .NET and C#) and later systems architect.

âš¡ I left development work to start ALM consulting, and was an ALM MVP between 2011 and 2022. I am passionate about helping teams improve the quality of their software, and do it more efficiently and securely.

âš¡ I worked as a DevOps consultant for 8 years before becoming a Solution Architect, doing technical pre-sales work. I then ran a DevOps practice before joining GitHub.

âš¡ I am a frequent guest speaker and blog regularly at [http://colinsalmcorner.com](http://colinsalmcorner.com) and can be found on twitter at @colindembovsky.

âš¡ When I am not working, I am playing guitar, mandolin or drums, 3D printing on my Ender3, flying my drone, boardgaming, cooking or entertaining my wife and 2 kids.
