### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I am a Cloud Solution Architect, DevOpsologist and ALM MVP working at the Cognizant Microsoft Business Group. 

âš¡ I live in the US but am proudly South African! 

âš¡ After completing an MSc in Computer Science at Rhodes University, I worked as a developer (first in Linux using C++ and moving to .NET and C#) and later systems architect.

âš¡ I left development work to start ALM consulting, and have been an ALM MVP since 2011. I am passionate about helping teams improve the quality of their software, and do it more efficiently. 

âš¡ Besides consulting and training, I am a frequent guest speaker and blog regularly at [http://colinsalmcorner.com](http://colinsalmcorner.com) and can be found on twitter at @colindembovsky.

âš¡ When I am not working on an Azure DevOps account somewhere, I am playing guitar, mandolin or drums and recording in my home studio, boardgaming, cooking, 3D printing or entertaining my wife and 2 kids.
